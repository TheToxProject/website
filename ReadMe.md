# üåê The Tox Website

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/TheToxProject/website.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TheToxProject/website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TheToxProject/website) [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

This project aims to provide a simple yet useful promotional website for Tox. I found that the current website is **not** user-friendly nor gives a strong brand image to Tox. So I decided to start a fresh brand-new website, written with React, and to design illustrations that convey the right message. Branding is an important part of a project, as it permits to build a community, to deliver a message and to give people more choice.

Also, this project tries to address many issue we had with the old website such as OS detection, layouting, localization (i18n) and design.
